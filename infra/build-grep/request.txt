Please write the source code to create an OCI container named 'cgrep'. This container should 
provide a container interface over the unix utility grep.

To create this container, please use a Red Hat image that has a Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) 
from the "ironbank" Docker repository (registry1.dso.mil) such as ubi8-minimal.

Please then provide the instructions to build the cgrep container and then run it from my PC command line.
