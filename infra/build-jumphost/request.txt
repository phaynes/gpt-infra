Please write the source code to create an OCI container named "BuildJumpHost". This container should build a virtual machine (VM) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and assign a specific IP address to the hostname "1sky-jump". The IP address should be recorded against the DNS A record "1sky-jump.dnsdevsecops.com", which is hosted by CloudFlare. The purpose of this VM is to act as a jump host for other VMs.

To create this container, please use a Red Hat image that has a Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) from the "ironbank" Docker repository (registry1.dso.mil) such as ubi8-minimal. Please use the account "Philip_Haynes" and the password "5JaeSknfGCdTg1TNrVhilLNsgQlV0AMm" to access the registry.

BuildJumpHost must have the following capabilities:

Run Ansible
Use Ansible to create a VM on AWS in the Sydney region. Please use a t2.micro instance type with an Amazon Linux 2023 AMI, and use the access key pair "1SkyDemo". The VPC to be used is "vpc-01d625522816619eb". The VM image is ami-0f6ad051716c81af1. 
Install Docker on the VM
Assign the hostname "1sky-jump" to the VM's specific IP address
Provide access to the VM for a management public key called "1SkyDemo", which uses the ed25519 algorithm.
Record the VM's IP address and associate it with the A record for "1sky-jump.dnsdevsecops.com", which is hosted by CloudFlare.
Upon successful creation of the container, it should be possible to run it and build a VM that can be logged into. Please provide instructions on how to do so.

Additionally, please provide an Ansible script that can be used to terminate the VM and destroy all its resources.
